- Grid Power
- Total System Power
- Total Active Power

#### PV String Sensors (12)
- PV1-4 Voltage
- PV1-4 Current
- PV1-4 Power

#### Battery Sensors (6)
- Battery SOC (State of Charge)
- Battery Voltage
- Battery Current
- Battery Temperature
- Battery Capacity
- Battery Power

#### Grid Sensors (4)
- Grid R-Phase Voltage
- Grid R-Phase Current
- Grid R-Phase Power
- Grid Frequency

#### Energy Statistics (10)
- Daily Consumption
- Total Consumption
- Daily Grid Feed-in
- Total Grid Feed-in
- Daily Energy Purchased
- Total Energy Purchased
- Daily Charging Energy
- Total Charging Energy
- Daily Discharging Energy
- Total Discharging Energy

#### Inverter Sensors (3)

- Rated Power

#### Binary Sensors (2)
- Online Status
- Battery Charging

## Step 5: Set Up Energy Dashboard (Optional)

1. Go to **Settings** → **Dashboards** → **Energy**
2. Click **ADD CONSUMPTION** for each category:

### Solar Production
- Select: `sensor.{your_device}_pv_generation_power`

### Battery Storage
- Select: `sensor.{your_device}_battery_power`

### Grid Consumption
- Select: `sensor.{your_device}_daily_energy_purchased`

### Return to Grid
- Select: `sensor.{your_device}_daily_grid_feed_in`

3. Save and wait for data to accumulate

## Step 6: Create a Dashboard (Optional)

Add sensors to your dashboard:

```yaml
type: entities
title: Solar System
entities:
  - entity: sensor.{device}_pv_generation_power
    name: Solar Production
  - entity: sensor.{device}_battery_power
    name: Battery Power
  - entity: sensor.{device}_battery_soc
    name: Battery Level
  - entity: sensor.{device}_load_power
    name: House Load
  - entity: sensor.{device}_grid_power
    name: Grid Power
  - entity: binary_sensor.{device}_online_status
    name: System Online
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"
- ✅ Double-check your Client ID and Client Secret
- ✅ Make sure you copied the authorization code correctly (no extra spaces)
- ✅ Try logging out and back into the Hinen platform

### "No devices found"
- ✅ Open the Hinen mobile app and verify your devices appear there
- ✅ Contact Hinen support to ensure your developer account has device access
- ✅ Try a different region code if you're unsure of your data center

### Sensors show "Unavailable"
- ✅ Check your internet connection
- ✅ Verify the integration shows as "Connected" in Settings → Devices & Services
- ✅ Try reloading the integration
- ✅ Check Home Assistant logs: Settings → System → Logs

### Token expired
- The integration automatically refreshes tokens
- If you see persistent authentication errors:
  1. Go to Settings → Devices & Services
  2. Find Hinen Solar
  3. Click the three dots (⋮)
  4. Select "Delete"
  5. Re-add the integration
